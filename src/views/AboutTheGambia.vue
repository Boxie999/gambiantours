    <h1>About the Gambia</h1>
    <p>The Republic of The Gambia is continental Africa's smallest country, but don't let the diminutive size fool you into thinking the land has little to offer. The geography is more varied than many of its continental peers, with a wide range of natural ecosystems and a diverse array of flora and fauna to enjoy. The country has several internationally important protected areas, which stand it in good stead as interest in ecotourism grows.</p>
